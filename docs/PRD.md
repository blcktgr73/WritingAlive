## Product Vision Summary

WriteAlive is an AI-assisted writing tool that enables writers to practice "Saligo Writing" (살리고 글쓰기, Living-Centered Writing) - a methodology developed by **June Kim (김창준)**, inspired by Christopher Alexander's "The Nature of Order" and Bill Evans' step-by-step mastery philosophy.

**Evolution from Single-Mode to Bidirectional System**:
- **Original Vision** (Seed-Based): Bottom-up discovery from scattered thoughts → Ideal for exploratory essays, personal reflection, creative writing
- **Enhanced Vision** (Outcome-Driven & Hybrid): Supports both discovery AND intention → Extends to professional reports, academic papers, structured arguments

Rather than forcing writers into traditional outline-first approaches, WriteAlive now supports **three complementary writing modes**:
1. **Seed-Based** (Discovery): Ideas grow organically from seed centers → Low energy barrier, maximum creativity
2. **Outcome-Driven** (Intention): Define writing goals, AI provides gentle structure → Professional efficiency, deadline-driven writing
3. **Hybrid** (Discovery + Intention): Combine seeds with outcomes → Academic research, thesis writing, literature reviews

The tool transforms writing from a high-friction, structure-heavy activity into a fluid, generative process - whether you're exploring scattered thoughts or working toward a specific goal.

**Core Philosophy**: Writing as a living structure that evolves through generative sequences, not as a static artifact produced through rigid planning. Even goal-oriented writing proceeds through small, truthful steps.

**Primary Value Proposition**: Enable anyone to write with clarity and depth by starting small, building truthfully, and evolving naturally - just as Bill Evans taught musicians to master jazz one step at a time. Now supporting both exploratory discovery (30% of users) and intentional goal-driven writing (70% of professional knowledge workers).

## Core Principles: How Centers Live and Grow Across All Modes

**The fundamental insight**: Whether you start with seeds or outcomes, writing only gains "life" when **centers emerge, evolve, and strengthen** through iterative refinement.

### What Are Centers?

**Centers** are the structural pivots that hold a piece of writing together. They are:
- **Not just topics**: A topic is "feedback loops" (static). A center is "temporal delay compounds error propagation" (dynamic, structural)
- **Living elements**: They start weak and strengthen as you write
- **Relational**: Centers exist in relationship to other elements (seeds, sections, arguments)
- **Measurable**: Through wholeness scores (1-10) indicating structural coherence

### Center Evolution in Three Modes

#### 1. Seed-Based Mode: Centers Emerge from Connections

**Process**:
```
Scattered Seeds → AI Discovers Potential Centers → Select Strongest → Write → Centers Strengthen
```

**Example**:
- **Seeds**: Bill Evans quote, guitar practice note, code review insight, tree photo
- **Discovered Center** (weak): "Practice and mastery"
- **After writing iteration 1** (medium): "Completeness vs approximation in skill development"
- **After iteration 2** (strong): "Small truthful steps compound into mastery faster than vague approximations"
- **Wholeness progression**: 6.5 → 7.8 → 9.1

**Key**: Centers weren't predetermined - they emerged from writing about seed relationships and gained clarity through revision.

---

#### 2. Outcome-Driven Mode: Micro-Centers Serve the Whole

**Process**:
```
Define Outcome → AI Suggests Structure → Write Section 1 → Discover Section's Center → Repeat → Unify
```

**Example**:
- **Outcome**: "Q4 Project Retrospective: Wins, Challenges, Lessons"
- **Section 1 Center** (emerges while writing "Wins"): "User retention surge as leading indicator"
- **Section 2 Center** (emerges while writing "Challenges"): "Technical debt masks feature velocity"
- **Section 3 Center** (emerges while writing "Lessons"): "Metrics reveal truth that narratives obscure"
- **Document-Level Center** (emerges from unifying sections): "Data-driven retrospection prevents repeated mistakes"
- **Wholeness progression**: Sections start at 7.0 each, unified document reaches 8.5

**Key**: Even with predetermined structure (outcome), each section develops its own living center through small iterative steps. The final document's wholeness depends on how well section-centers support the outcome-center.

---

#### 3. Hybrid Mode: Centers Align Purpose with Insight

**Process**:
```
Define Outcome + Gather Seeds → AI Finds Outcome-Aligned Centers → Select → Write → Centers Deepen Both Ways
```

**Example**:
- **Outcome**: "Literature review on temporal delay in feedback loops"
- **Seeds**: 18 academic papers + 5 personal observations
- **Discovered Hybrid Center**: "Temporal delay problem manifests differently across domains but shares structural cause"
- **Writing iteration 1** (alignment: 0.85, depth: 0.70): Center serves thesis, but insights feel shallow
- **Iteration 2** (alignment: 0.92, depth: 0.85): Added cross-domain patterns from seeds, deepened understanding while maintaining thesis focus
- **Final** (alignment: 0.94, depth: 0.92): Center both proves thesis AND reveals unexpected insight (delay compounds non-linearly)
- **Wholeness formula**: Alignment × Depth = 0.94 × 0.92 = 0.86 (8.6/10)

**Key**: Hybrid centers must satisfy dual constraints: serve the outcome (alignment) AND reveal genuine insight from seeds (depth). Wholeness measures both dimensions.

---

### Wholeness: The Measure of Center Life

**Wholeness** quantifies how well centers give structure "life":

**Universal Wholeness Criteria** (All Modes):
1. **Unity**: Does the center hold disparate elements together?
2. **Clarity**: Is the center's core idea sharp and specific?
3. **Strength**: Does writing from this center feel generative (not forced)?
4. **Evolution**: Does the center deepen through iterative refinement?

**Mode-Specific Wholeness**:

| Mode | Wholeness Measures | Target Score |
|------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Seed-Based** | How well center unifies disparate seeds into coherent narrative | 7.5+/10 |
| **Outcome-Driven** | Section wholeness (internal coherence) + Document wholeness (sections serve outcome) | 8.0+/10 |
| **Hybrid** | Alignment score (serves outcome) × Depth score (reveals insight) | 8.5+/10 |

**Continuous Feedback Loop**:
- WriteAlive checks wholeness after each significant edit
- Low wholeness (< 6.0) → AI suggests: "Center may be too vague. Can you make it more specific?"
- Medium wholeness (6.0-7.5) → AI suggests expansion directions that strengthen center
- High wholeness (7.5+) → AI confirms: "This center is holding well. Consider how it connects to other sections."

---

### Why This Matters: Living Structure vs Static Outline

**Traditional Outline Approach** (Static):
```
1. Introduction
2. Body Paragraph 1
3. Body Paragraph 2
4. Conclusion
```
- Structure predetermined
- No centers, no life
- Writing feels mechanical
- Wholeness: N/A (structure doesn't evolve)

**Saligo Approach - All Three Modes** (Living):
```
Start → Write small truthful step → Discover emerging center → Strengthen through revision → Check wholeness → Iterate
```
- Structure emerges (seed-based) OR sections develop their own centers (outcome-driven) OR centers align dual goals (hybrid)
- Centers gain strength through writing
- Writing feels generative
- Wholeness: Continuously measured and improved (6.0 → 7.5 → 9.0)

**The Guarantee**: If wholeness increases through iterations, your writing is gaining structural life. If wholeness stagnates or decreases, the center is weak or writing has lost direction.

📝 Quick mobile capture in Obsidian:
```markdown
# 2025-11-04-subway-note.md
Watched Bill Evans video.
"Don't approximate the whole vaguely" was shocking.
I've always tried to play entire guitar songs roughly.
#seed #practice
```

**Tuesday 12:30 PM** - Lunch break, reflecting on yesterday's guitar practice
📝 Mobile voice memo (auto-synced to Obsidian):
```markdown
# 2025-11-05-lunch-idea.md
When I practiced guitar yesterday
I practiced only the first 4 bars perfectly
The rest came easily after
#idea #guitar #💡
```

**Wednesday 2 PM** - During code review at work, sudden insight
📝 Quick desktop note:
```markdown
# 2025-11-06-meeting-thought.md
Realized during code review:
Writing one small function properly
is better than roughing out the whole structure
This is also Bill Evans' approach, right?
#seed #programming
```

**Thursday Evening** - Walk in park, sees tree growth pattern
📝 Mobile photo + note:
```markdown
# 2025-11-07-park-walk.md
![[tree-growth.jpg]]
Trees grow from trunk to branches.
Shouldn't writing work the same way?
#seed #nature
```

## Step-by-Step Saligo Writing Workflow

This section describes the complete Saligo Writing process as experienced in the tutorial, with time estimates for each phase.

### Phase 1: Seed Gathering (5-10 minutes total)

**Multi-Day Collection Pattern** (Recommended):
- **Monday-Thursday**: Capture 1-2 seeds per day (1-2 min each)
  - Mobile capture during: commute, lunch break, meetings, walks
  - Use quick tags: `#seed`, `#idea`, `#💡`, `#thought`
  - Include photos when relevant (visual seeds)
  - Voice memos auto-transcribed and synced
- **Total distributed time**: ~6-8 minutes over 4 days
- **Cognitive load**: Minimal (just capture, no organizing)

**Single-Session Gathering** (Alternative):
- **Friday evening**: Run `WriteAlive: Gather Seeds` command
  - System finds all tagged seeds from vault
  - Filter by date range ("This week", "This month")
  - Review and select relevant seeds
- **Time**: 5 minutes
- **Output**: 4-10 seeds ready for writing

### Phase 2: Center Discovery (3-5 minutes)

**Command**: `WriteAlive: Find Centers` (auto-triggers after seed document creation)

**AI Analysis**:
- Analyzes selected seeds for common themes
- Identifies 2-4 potential centers
- Ranks by strength: Strong (⭐⭐⭐), Medium (⭐⭐), Weak (⭐)
- Provides recommendation: "Start with Center X - it's the most alive"

**Example Output**:
```
🎯 Centers Discovered:

1. [Strong Center ⭐⭐⭐] "Completeness vs Approximation"
   Core concept connecting all seeds

2. [Medium Center ⭐⭐] "Part to Whole Growth"
   Natural expansion pattern

3. [Weak Center ⭐] "Cross-domain Application"
   Same principle in different contexts
```

**User Action**:
- Review suggested centers
- Select starting center (usually the strongest)
- Begin writing first paragraph

### Phase 3: Initial Writing (5-10 minutes)

**Low Energy Start**:
- Write 1-3 paragraphs exploring chosen center
- No need for complete structure or outline
- Focus on being "entirely true" about small part (Bill Evans principle)
- AI observes but doesn't interrupt

**Example First Paragraph** (from tutorial):
```markdown
Bill Evans said: "Don't approximate the whole vaguely.
Take a small part and be entirely true about it."
I heard this and reflected on my guitar practice.
```

**Outcome**: 3-5 sentences that feel authentic and complete in themselves

### Phase 4: Generative Expansion (10-20 minutes)

**Command**: `WriteAlive: Suggest Expansions`

**AI Offers Multiple Directions**:
```
🌿 How your writing wants to grow:

Option A: Add Concrete Experience (⭐⭐⭐ Recommended)
  "What happened when you practiced those 4 bars perfectly?
   Make readers feel that experience."

Option B: Use Nature Metaphor (⭐⭐)
  "How does tree growth mirror your practice?
   Develop while looking at the photo."

Option C: Connect to Programming (⭐)
  "Same discovery in code review?
   What was that moment?"
```

**Iterative Expansion Process**:
1. User selects Option A → Writes concrete experience (10 min)
2. Wholeness check: 7.2/10
3. User selects Option B → Adds tree metaphor (5 min)
4. Wholeness check: 8.3/10
5. Optional: Select Option C for additional depth

**Key Principle**: Each expansion builds on previous work, not parallel branches

### Phase 5: Wholeness Analysis (2-3 minutes)

**Command**: `WriteAlive: Analyze Wholeness`

**AI Structural Feedback**:
```
📊 Wholeness Analysis Result

Overall Score: 8.3/10 (Very Good)

✅ Strengths:
  • Explains abstract concept with concrete experience (strong center)
  • Natural flow: "hear → reflect → apply → understand"
  • Tree metaphor reinforces practice principle

⚠️ Room for Improvement:
  • Programming example not yet connected (unused seed)
  • Transition between paragraphs 2-3 slightly abrupt
  • Conclusion could tie back to opening more explicitly

💡 Next Iteration:
  Adding Option C (programming) could raise wholeness to 9.0+
  Smoothing transition would improve flow
```

**Progression Tracking**:
- Initial: 7.2/10
- After 1st expansion: 8.3/10
- After polish: 9.1/10
- **User sees concrete improvement metrics**

### Phase 6: Refinement & Polish (2-5 minutes)

**Command**: `WriteAlive: Read Aloud Feedback`

**AI Identifies**:
- Awkward phrasing (rhythm issues)
- Overly long sentences
- Unclear transitions
- Redundant phrases

**Example Feedback**:
```
🔊 Read Aloud Analysis

✅ Reads Well:
  • "Something amazing happened" - good rhythm
  • "trunk → branches → leaves" - clear repetition

⚠️ Awkward Parts:
  • "That's when I understood physically" - slightly awkward
  → Suggestion: "That's when I physically grasped"

  • "Accurate notes came out without thinking" - too long
  → Suggestion: "Notes came out effortlessly"
```

**User Makes Quick Edits**: Fix 2-3 awkward phrases

### Phase 7: Snapshot & Completion (1 minute)

**Command**: `WriteAlive: Save Snapshot`

**Final Snapshot**:
```
✅ Snapshot saved: "My Practice Method - Final (Wholeness 9.1)"

You can return to this version anytime.
Safe to experiment further!
```

**Document Status**: Ready to share, publish, or develop further

## Core User Stories

### Epic 0: Seed Gathering from Daily Notes (MVP - Highest Priority)
**Priority**: P0 (Must Have - Critical Differentiator)
**Effort**: Medium (5-8 story points)
**Rationale**: This is the bridge between scattered daily observations and coherent writing. Without this, users must manually organize ideas before starting, defeating the "low energy barrier" promise.

#### US-0.1: Vault-Wide Seed Collection
**As a** knowledge worker who captures fleeting ideas throughout the day
**I want** the system to automatically find all my tagged seeds across my Obsidian vault
**So that** I can start writing without manually searching through hundreds of notes

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- User invokes command: "Gather my seeds" (Ctrl+P → WriteAlive: Gather Seeds)
- System searches vault for configurable seed tags (Settings):
  - Default: `#seed`, `#writealive-seed`
  - User can add custom tags: `#idea`, `#thought`, `#fleeting`, `#💡`, etc.
  - Support for multiple tags (OR logic): matches any of the configured tags
  - Tag aliases: `#씨앗` (Korean) = `#seed`
- Returns results with metadata in modal/sidebar:
  - Original note title and path
  - Seed text (paragraph containing tag)
  - Creation date
  - Related backlinks (if any)
  - Photo attachments (if any) with thumbnail preview
  - Which tag(s) matched (e.g., `#seed`, `#💡`)
- Display format (from tutorial):
  ```markdown
  🌱 Seeds Found (4)

  ✅ 2025-11-04 - "Don't approximate the whole vaguely" #seed #practice
  ✅ 2025-11-05 - "First 4 bars perfectly" #idea #guitar #💡
  ✅ 2025-11-06 - "One small function properly" #seed #programming
  ✅ 2025-11-07 - "Trees grow from trunk to branches" #seed #nature

☑ Include default tags (#seed, #writealive-seed)
☑ Include emoji tags (#💡, #🌱, #💭)
☐ Case-sensitive matching
☑ Show photo previews in seed list
```

**Photo Seed Capture Flow (Mobile)**:
1. User sees inspiring tree growth pattern in park
2. Opens Obsidian Mobile → Quick capture
3. Takes photo (or selects from gallery)
4. Adds quick note: "Trees grow from trunk to branches. Shouldn't writing work the same way?"
5. Tags with `#seed #nature`
6. Auto-syncs to vault
7. Desktop "Gather Seeds" finds it with photo thumbnail
8. Photo becomes visual seed for writing (can reference in essay)

[AI Center Discovery automatically runs here]
```

**Real-World Scenario (Enhanced from Tutorial)**:
```
User gathered 4 seeds:
1. Bill Evans philosophy (subway, text) #seed
2. Guitar practice insight (lunch, voice memo) #idea #💡
3. Code review realization (office, text) #seed
4. Tree growth pattern (park walk, photo) #seed #nature

Workflow:
1. User reviews seeds in modal
2. Clicks "Select All" (or manually checks 4 seeds)
3. Clicks "Start Writing"
4. WriteAlive creates "My Practice Method.md"
5. Seeds listed in clean format with dates and tags
6. Photo embedded inline (tree-growth.jpg)
7. AI immediately analyzes and suggests centers:

🎯 Centers Discovered:

1. [Strong Center ⭐⭐⭐] "Completeness vs Approximation"
   Core of Bill Evans' philosophy
   Connects guitar, programming, natural growth

2. [Medium Center ⭐⭐] "Part to Whole Growth"
   Tree metaphor + practice pattern

3. [Weak Center ⭐] "Cross-domain Application"
   Same principle across different fields

💡 Recommendation: Start with Center 1 - it's the most alive

8. User immediately sees writing direction (no blank page anxiety)
9. Can start writing first paragraph with low energy
```

**Key Workflow Principles**:
- **No friction**: "All" button for quick selection
- **Seamless flow**: Document creation → AI analysis (no manual trigger)
- **Visual clarity**: Clean list format, not cluttered blockquotes
- **Photo integration**: Images embedded inline for reference while writing
- **Immediate guidance**: AI centers appear right after document creation
- **Zero blank page anxiety**: User never stares at empty cursor

**Structural Quality Metric**: 70% of documents created via seed gathering reach completion (vs 20% baseline for blank-page starts); 85% of users proceed to write within 2 minutes of seed document creation

---

#### US-0.3: AI-Powered Seed Clustering (Post-MVP Enhancement)
**As a** writer with many seeds on overlapping themes
**I want** AI to suggest which seeds naturally belong together
**So that** I don't have to manually group ideas before writing

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- After gathering seeds, user can invoke "Suggest Clusters"
- AI analyzes seed content and proposes 2-4 thematic groups
- Each cluster shows:
  - Suggested theme name (e.g., "Practice Philosophy", "Natural Growth Patterns")
  - Seeds in that cluster
  - Explanation: "These seeds share focus on..."
- User can accept clusters, merge, split, or ignore
- "Start writing from cluster [X]" creates document with only those seeds

**Structural Quality Metric**: Clustered seeds lead to 30% more coherent first drafts (measured by wholeness score)

---

#### US-0.4: MOC (Map of Contents) Integration
**As a** knowledge worker using MOC structure to organize notes
**I want** WriteAlive to recognize my MOCs and use them as writing starting points
**So that** I can leverage my existing knowledge organization for writing

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- User can designate notes as MOCs in plugin settings (via folder path, tag `#moc`, or YAML `type: moc`)
- "Start from MOC" command shows list of available MOCs
- MOC preview displays:
  - Title and structure
  - Linked notes count
  - Last modified date
  - Quick preview of links
- Selecting a MOC creates new document with:
  - All linked notes pulled in as context
  - Hierarchical structure preserved (H2/H3 sections → document sections)
  - Option to include full note content or just excerpts
- Auto-sync: When MOC is updated, WriteAlive suggests refreshing the writing document

**Real-World Scenario**:
```markdown
<!-- User's MOC: "Creativity and Practice.md" -->
# Creativity and Practice

## Foundational Concepts
- [[Christopher Alexander - Centers]]
- [[Bill Evans - Truth over Approximation]]
- [[Natural Growth Patterns]]

## Personal Observations
- [[2025-10-28 - Reading Nature of Order]]
- [[2025-10-29 - Walk observations]]

## Applications
- [[Saligo Writing Method]]
- [[Deliberate Practice in Writing]]

---
WriteAlive command: "Start from MOC"
→ Selects "Creativity and Practice"
→ New document created with all 7 linked notes as initial context
→ AI suggests: "Your MOC has 3 themes. Which would you like to explore first?"
```

**Structural Quality Metric**:
- MOC-initiated documents have 50% higher completion rate than seed-initiated (85% vs 70%)
- Average 10-15 linked notes per MOC
- 60% of users with MOC workflow adopt this feature

---

#### US-0.5: Auto-MOC Generation (Optional, Post-MVP)
**As a** writer who accumulates related notes but doesn't manually create MOCs
**I want** WriteAlive to suggest MOC candidates based on my note relationships
**So that** I can discover emergent knowledge structures

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- "Suggest MOCs" command analyzes vault for:
  - Notes with 5+ outbound links
  - Clusters of notes with mutual backlinks
  - Notes sharing common tags/folders
- Presents MOC candidates with:
  - Suggested title based on content
  - Proposed structure (hierarchical grouping)
  - Strength score (how cohesive the cluster is)
- User can accept, edit, or dismiss
- One-click "Create MOC + Start Writing" generates both MOC note and writing document

**Structural Quality Metric**: 40% of suggested MOCs are accepted and used for writing within 1 week

---

#### US-0.6: Living MOC Auto-Update
**As a** knowledge worker who captures seeds daily
**I want** my MOCs to automatically reflect new seeds with relevant tags
**So that** my knowledge maps stay current without manual maintenance

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- User enables "Living MOC" mode in MOC frontmatter:
  ```yaml
  ---
  writealive:
    auto_gather_seeds: true
    seed_tags: [creativity, practice, writing, 창의성]  # Multiple tags supported
    seed_tag_mode: any  # 'any' (OR) or 'all' (AND)
    update_frequency: daily  # or: realtime, manual
    include_global_seed_tags: true  # Also use tags from global settings
  ---
  ```
- MOC contains auto-update section markers:
  ```markdown
  ## Recent Seeds (Auto-updated)
  <!-- BEGIN WRITEALIVE-AUTO -->
  <!-- END WRITEALIVE-AUTO -->
  ```
- WriteAlive monitors vault for new notes matching MOC's `seed_tags`
- When new matching seed found:
  - **Realtime mode**: Immediately add to AUTO section
  - **Daily mode**: Show notification: "3 new seeds for 'Creativity' MOC" [Update Now] [Review]
  - **Manual mode**: Suggest during "Start from MOC" command
- Auto-section sorts by: recency (default), relevance, or custom
- User can move items from AUTO to manual sections (becomes permanent)
- Respects user edits: never overwrites manual content

**Real-World Scenario**:
```markdown
User's MOC: "Creativity and Practice.md"
---
writealive:
  auto_gather_seeds: true
  seed_tags: [creativity, practice, 창의성, 연습]  # Multilingual!
  seed_tag_mode: any
  update_frequency: daily
---

Monday: Reading book → "Alexander: centers" #creativity #씨앗
→ Matches MOC's "creativity" tag
→ [Notification] "1 new seed for 'Creativity and Practice' MOC"

Tuesday: Watching video → "Evans: truth" #practice #idea
→ Matches MOC's "practice" tag + global "#idea" tag
→ Auto-section now has 2 seeds

Wednesday: Korean note → "자연스러운 성장" #창의성 #씨앗
→ Matches MOC's "창의성" tag (Korean)
→ Auto-section now has 3 seeds

Sunday: "Start from MOC"
→ All 3 auto-gathered seeds + manual links as context
→ AI: "Your MOC has grown this week. I notice bilingual themes..."
```

**Three Implementation Approaches** (Choose 1 for MVP):

1. **Smart Markers** (Recommended for MVP)
   - Pros: Works with pure markdown, user control, clear boundaries
   - Cons: Requires marker discipline

2. **Dataview Integration** (If Dataview plugin available)
   - Pros: Real-time, no manual updates needed
   - Cons: Requires Dataview plugin, less portable

3. **Hybrid Notification** (Safest)
   - Pros: User always in control, no accidental overwrites
   - Cons: Requires user action, not truly "auto"

**Structural Quality Metric**:
- 50% of MOC users enable auto-update
- Auto-updated MOCs receive 2-3x more seeds than manual MOCs
- 70% of auto-gathered seeds are kept (not removed as irrelevant)
- Time saved: 5-10 min/week of manual MOC maintenance

**Edge Cases & Safety**:
- Never modify content outside AUTO markers
- If markers missing, suggest adding them (don't auto-inject)
- If multiple MOCs match same seed tags, ask user which to update
- Undo support: "Revert last auto-update"

### Epic 0.7: Enhanced Seed Discovery & Filtering (MVP)
**Priority**: P0 (Must Have - Critical UX Improvement)
**Effort**: Medium-Large (8-13 story points)
**Rationale**: Current workflow requires users to manually scan all seeds. Tag-based navigation and relationship awareness makes discovery intentional, focused, and reveals natural connections between ideas.

---

#### US-0.7.1: Tag-Based Seed Filtering

**As a** knowledge worker with 100+ seed notes across multiple topics
**I want** to filter seeds by specific tags before selecting
**So that** I can focus on a coherent theme rather than scanning unrelated ideas

**Acceptance Criteria**:

**Tag Filter UI (Gather Seeds Modal Enhancement)**:
- Display available tags with counts above seed list:
  ```
  🏷️ Filter by Tags (showing 15 tags):

  #practice (12)  #creativity (8)  #programming (15)  #nature (5)
  #writing (20)   #idea (45)       #💡 (23)           #guitar (6)

  [Show all tags ▼]
  ```
- Tags sorted by: frequency (default), alphabetical, or recent usage
- Multi-select tags with AND/OR toggle:
  ```
  Filter Mode: [ANY tag] [ALL tags]

  Selected: #practice AND #creativity (3 seeds)
  ```
- "Clear filters" button resets to all seeds
- Tag selection persists across modal re-opens (session storage)

**Tag Metadata Enhancements**:
- Show tag co-occurrence: "Often paired with #creativity, #idea"
- Display date range: "Used from 2025-10-15 to 2025-11-03"
- Show related tags (appear in same notes): "#practice → #guitar (60%), #programming (40%)"

**Filter Interaction**:
- Clicking tag toggles selection (visual state: selected/unselected)
- Selected tags highlighted with accent color
- Real-time seed count update: "Showing 12 of 45 seeds"
- Combine with existing date filters: "This week + #practice (5 seeds)"

**Real-World Scenario**:
```markdown
User opens "Gather Seeds" with 150 total seeds

🏷️ Available Tags:
#practice (12)  #creativity (8)  #idea (45)  #programming (15)

1. User clicks #practice → 12 seeds shown
   "Seeds about practice methods from past 2 weeks"

2. User clicks #creativity (while #practice still selected)
   Filter Mode: [ANY tag]
   → 20 seeds shown (12 practice + 8 creativity)

3. User toggles to [ALL tags]
   → 3 seeds shown (have BOTH #practice AND #creativity)

4. User sees: "3 seeds found: practice methods applied to creative work"
   These are likely highly related!

5. Click "Find Centers" → AI discovers theme:
   "Deliberate Practice for Creative Mastery"
```

**Structural Quality Metric**:
- Tag navigation reduces time-to-relevant-seeds by 60% (from 3 min → 70 sec)
- 80% of users who filter by tag complete writing session
- Average 2.5 tags used per session
- Tag filter accuracy: 95% of filtered seeds are relevant to user's writing goal

### Epic 2: AI-Assisted Center Discovery (MVP)
**Priority**: P0 (Must Have)
**Effort**: Large (13-21 story points)
**Rationale**: Core AI capability that makes Saligo Writing accessible to non-experts

#### US-2.1: Center Identification
**As a** writer developing my draft
**I want** AI to suggest potential centers in my existing text
**So that** I can identify structural pivots for expansion without expertise in Alexander's methodology

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Auto-triggers after seed document creation (seamless workflow)
- Manual trigger: User selects paragraph/section → "Find Centers" command
- AI analyzes text using GPT-4/Claude and returns 2-4 potential centers
- **Strength-based ranking** (from tutorial):
  - Strong Center (⭐⭐⭐): High energy, connects multiple themes
  - Medium Center (⭐⭐): Moderate energy, good potential
  - Weak Center (⭐): Low energy, optional to explore
- Each center includes:
  - Center name/theme (e.g., "Completeness vs Approximation")
  - Brief explanation (why this holds energy)
  - Recommendation (which to start with)
- Display format (from tutorial):
  ```
  🎯 Centers Discovered:

  1. [Strong Center ⭐⭐⭐] "Completeness vs Approximation"
     Core of Bill Evans' philosophy
     Connects guitar, programming, natural growth

  2. [Medium Center ⭐⭐] "Part to Whole Growth"
     Tree metaphor + practice pattern

  3. [Weak Center ⭐] "Cross-domain Application"
     Same principle across different fields

  💡 Recommendation: Start with Center 1 - it's the most alive
  ```
- User can:
  - Accept center (begins writing from that theme)
  - Modify center name/focus
  - Dismiss and request alternatives
  - See all centers simultaneously (compare strength)
- Accepted centers tracked in document metadata (for wholeness analysis)
- AI considers: recurring concepts, emotional resonance, cross-seed connections, structural pivots, unresolved tensions

**Real-World Scenario (from Tutorial)**:
```
Seeds analyzed:
1. "Don't approximate the whole vaguely" #seed #practice
2. "First 4 bars perfectly" #idea #guitar
3. "One small function properly" #seed #programming
4. "Trees grow from trunk to branches" #seed #nature

AI identifies:
- Strong Center (⭐⭐⭐): "Completeness over Approximation"
  → Present in ALL 4 seeds (music, code, nature)
  → Emotionally charged ("shocking", "realized")
  → Actionable (user has concrete experiences)

- Medium Center (⭐⭐): "Natural Growth Patterns"
  → Tree metaphor + practice progression
  → Visual seed (photo) strengthens it

- Weak Center (⭐): "Cross-domain Learning"
  → Observable but less developed
  → Could be future expansion

User chooses Strong Center → Writes first paragraph immediately
```

**Structural Quality Metric**: Users accept 60%+ of suggested Strong Centers (⭐⭐⭐); 50%+ overall center acceptance rate; 80% of users proceed to write within 2 minutes of seeing center suggestions

---

#### US-2.2: Generative Expansion Prompts
**As a** writer staring at my seed idea
**I want** AI to suggest expansion strategies for my current center
**So that** I can overcome writer's block and explore multiple directions

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- User invokes "Suggest Expansions" command (Ctrl+P → WriteAlive: Suggest Expansions)
- AI analyzes current draft + unused seeds to suggest 3-5 expansion directions
- **Option-based presentation** (from tutorial):
  - Each option labeled (Option A, B, C...)
  - Strength rating: ⭐⭐⭐ (Recommended), ⭐⭐ (Good), ⭐ (Optional)
  - Expansion strategy explained (what type of growth)
  - Guiding question to help user write
- Display format (from tutorial):
  ```
  🌿 How your writing wants to grow:

  Option A: Add Concrete Experience (⭐⭐⭐ Recommended)
    "What happened when you practiced those 4 bars perfectly?
     Make readers feel that experience."

  Option B: Use Nature Metaphor (⭐⭐)
    "How does tree growth mirror your practice?
     Develop while looking at the photo."

  Option C: Connect to Programming (⭐)
    "Same discovery in code review?
     What was that moment?"
  ```
- User can:
  - Select option → AI provides 2-3 starter prompts (optional, not auto-writing)
  - Dismiss option → Show alternative directions
  - Iterate: "Show more options" after completing one expansion
  - Track which seeds have been used vs unused (visual indicator)
- **Iterative workflow** (from tutorial):
  - After Option A expansion → Wholeness check → Suggest next options
  - Each expansion builds on previous (not parallel branches)
  - Unused seeds highlighted as potential future options
- All suggestions are non-intrusive (sidebar/modal, easily dismissible)
- No auto-writing: AI suggests directions, user writes content

**Expansion Strategy Types** (AI uses mix of these):
1. **Concrete Experience**: Add specific story/example
2. **Metaphor/Analogy**: Use visual or conceptual comparison
3. **Cross-domain Connection**: Link to other fields/interests
4. **Causal Exploration**: Trace backward (why?) or forward (what happens?)
5. **Counter-perspective**: Explore opposing view or tension
6. **Structural Pattern**: Identify underlying principle

**Real-World Scenario (from Tutorial)**:
```
User has written first paragraph:
"Bill Evans said: 'Don't approximate the whole vaguely.
 Take a small part and be entirely true about it.'
 I heard this and reflected on my guitar practice."

Unused seeds:
- Guitar practice (4 bars) #idea #💡
- Code review insight #seed #programming
- Tree photo #seed #nature

AI analyzes and suggests:
Option A (⭐⭐⭐): "Add your guitar story - you have concrete experience seed!"
  → User selects, writes 3 paragraphs about 4-bar practice
  → Wholeness: 7.2/10

Option B (⭐⭐): "Your tree photo is waiting - natural growth metaphor"
  → User selects, adds tree paragraph
  → Wholeness: 8.3/10

Option C (⭐): "Programming seed unused - cross-domain connection?"
  → User skips (essay feels complete)

AI notices: "Wholeness is 8.3 - very good! Option C could push to 9.0+, but not required."
```

**Structural Quality Metric**: 70% of stuck sessions (>5 min no text) successfully resume after prompt use; 85% of users explore 2+ expansion options; avg 2.5 expansions per document

---

#### US-2.3: Wholeness Analysis
**As a** writer with multiple paragraphs
**I want** AI to assess the wholeness/coherence of my document
**So that** I can identify weak connections, redundancies, or missing pieces

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- User invokes "Analyze Wholeness" command (Ctrl+P → WriteAlive: Analyze Wholeness)
- Can be run on: full document, selected section, or auto-triggered after expansions
- AI evaluates:
  - Paragraph unity (does each paragraph have one clear message?)
  - Inter-paragraph transitions (do ideas flow naturally?)
  - Center hierarchy (are main ideas clearly dominant?)
  - Structural gaps (what's missing to complete the thought?)
  - Unused seeds (what potential remains unexplored?)
- **Wholeness score**: 1-10 with detailed explanation
  - 7.0-7.9: Good writing, coherent structure
  - 8.0-8.9: Very good, strong centers and flow
  - 9.0-10.0: Excellent, high cohesion and wholeness
- **Structured feedback format** (from tutorial):
  ```
  📊 Wholeness Analysis Result

  Overall Score: 8.3/10 (Very Good)

  ✅ Strengths:
    • Explains abstract concept with concrete experience (strong center)
    • Natural flow: "hear → reflect → apply → understand"
    • Tree metaphor reinforces practice principle

  ⚠️ Room for Improvement:
    • Programming example not yet connected (unused seed)
    • Transition between paragraphs 2-3 slightly abrupt
    • Conclusion could tie back to opening more explicitly

  💡 Next Iteration:
    Adding Option C (programming) could raise wholeness to 9.0+
    Smoothing transition would improve flow
  ```
- **Progression tracking** (from tutorial):
  - Track wholeness scores over time: 7.2 → 8.3 → 9.1
  - Show improvement graph (visual feedback)
  - Celebrate milestones: "You've reached 9.0+ wholeness!"
  - Store scores in document metadata for historical view
- Specific actionable suggestions:
  - "Paragraph 3 and 7 seem to repeat the same idea - consider merging"
  - "Transition between Para 2→3 needs connector phrase"
  - "Programming seed unused - potential for cross-domain depth"
- Optional: Visual map showing strong connections (green), weak links (yellow), gaps (red)

**Real-World Scenario (from Tutorial)**:
```
User writes initial draft → Wholeness: 7.2/10
AI feedback:
  ✅ Good: Concrete guitar story
  ⚠️ Missing: Tree metaphor seed unused, conclusion weak

User adds tree metaphor expansion → Wholeness: 8.3/10
AI feedback:
  ✅ Strengths: Metaphor reinforces concept, natural flow improved
  ⚠️ Room: Programming seed still unused, could add depth

User polishes transitions → Wholeness: 9.1/10
AI feedback:
  ✅ Excellent wholeness! Strong centers, natural flow, clear conclusion
  💡 Programming seed optional at this point - essay feels complete

User sees progression: 7.2 → 8.3 → 9.1 (concrete improvement)
```

**Key Principles**:
- **Progressive scoring**: Not one-time pass/fail, but iterative improvement
- **Actionable feedback**: Specific suggestions, not vague critique
- **Celebrate progress**: Highlight improvements, not just deficits
- **Unused seed awareness**: Remind of unexplored potential without pressure

**Structural Quality Metric**: Documents with 7+ wholeness score are 90% complete by user assessment; users with progression tracking complete 40% more documents; avg 3 wholeness checks per document

**I want** to hear my text read aloud with AI voice AND get feedback on awkward phrasing
**So that** I can identify rhythm issues and unclear passages through both listening and AI analysis

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- User invokes "Read Aloud Feedback" command (Ctrl+P → WriteAlive: Read Aloud Feedback)
- **Two-part feature**:
  1. **Audio playback**:
     - Text-to-speech with natural intonation (browser API or service)
     - Reading highlights current sentence
     - Pause/resume controls
     - User can click to edit while listening (playback pauses)
     - Speed control: 0.8x, 1x, 1.2x
  2. **AI rhythm analysis** (from tutorial):
     - Identifies awkward phrasing, overly long sentences, unclear transitions
     - Provides specific suggestions with before/after examples
- **Feedback format** (from tutorial):
  ```
  🔊 Read Aloud Analysis

  ✅ Reads Well:
    • "Something amazing happened" - good rhythm
    • "trunk → branches → leaves" - clear repetition

  ⚠️ Awkward Parts:
    • "That's when I understood physically" - slightly awkward
    → Suggestion: "That's when I physically grasped"

    • "Accurate notes came out without thinking" - too long
    → Suggestion: "Notes came out effortlessly"
       OR split: "Accurate notes came out. I didn't need to think."
  ```
- User can:
  - Accept suggestion (one-click edit)
  - Modify suggestion
  - Dismiss and keep original
  - Re-run after edits to verify improvements
- AI considers: sentence length (15-25 words ideal), rhythm variation, transition smoothness, redundant phrases

**Real-World Scenario (from Tutorial)**:
```
User finishes draft, runs "Read Aloud Feedback"

AI identifies:
1. "That's when I understood physically" → awkward adverb placement
   Suggestion: "That's when I physically grasped" ✓ (more natural)

2. "Accurate notes came out without thinking" → 6 words, but feels long
   Suggestion: "Notes came out effortlessly" ✓ (more concise)

User accepts both → Re-runs wholeness → 8.3 → 9.1

User also listens to audio → Catches one more awkward transition
Edits manually → Final polish complete
```

**Key Principles**:
- **Dual feedback**: Both AI analysis AND audio playback (complement each other)
- **Specific suggestions**: Not "this is awkward" but "try this instead"
- **Optional application**: User always in control, can dismiss all
- **Fast iteration**: Quick re-run after edits to verify

**Structural Quality Metric**: 40% of documents use read-aloud before marking "complete"; 70% of AI suggestions accepted; avg 2-3 phrasing improvements per document

- Labels appear as subtle margin annotations (not inline)
- "Structure View" shows document as labeled outline
- AI can suggest labels: "This paragraph seems to provide evidence for claim in Para 2"
- Labels are optional - never required to proceed

**Structural Quality Metric**: 60% of academic users adopt paragraph labeling

---

#### US-4.2: Section Coherence Check
**As an** academic writer
**I want** to verify each paragraph has unity (one clear message)
**So that** my writing meets academic standards for paragraph structure

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- User invokes "Check Paragraph Unity" on any paragraph
- AI evaluates: Does this paragraph have one main idea?
- If fragmented, suggests: "This paragraph discusses [A] and [B] - consider splitting"

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- **Latency**: AI responses (center identification, expansions) < 3 seconds for 90th percentile
- **Offline**: Full markdown editing works offline; AI features queue for sync
- **Large Documents**: Support documents up to 50,000 words without performance degradation
- **Concurrent Sessions**: Handle user editing same document across 2 devices with CRDTs or OT

### Security & Privacy
- **API Keys**: Stored encrypted locally (browser crypto API) or in user-controlled env files
- **Data Storage**: User owns data - markdown files in their GitHub repo or local filesystem
- **No Central Storage**: WriteAlive never stores document content on servers (stateless API calls)
- **Audit Trail**: All AI requests logged locally with timestamps for user review
- **GDPR Compliance**: Minimal data collection; user can export/delete all data

### Scalability
- **Stateless Backend**: All AI orchestration stateless (can scale horizontally)
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement client-side rate limiting to prevent API cost overruns
- **Caching**: Cache AI responses for identical requests (24hr TTL) to reduce costs
- **Batch Processing**: Queue multiple AI requests and process in optimized batches

### Accessibility
- **WCAG 2.1 AA**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader support, sufficient contrast
- **Read-Aloud**: Support for users with dyslexia or visual impairments
- **Customizable UI**: Font size, spacing, color themes (high contrast mode)
- **Mobile Touch**: Large touch targets (44x44px min), swipe gestures for version comparison

### Internationalization
- **Primary**: Korean (한국어) and English (US)
- **UI Translation**: All interface strings in i18n files (react-i18next or similar)
- **LLM Language Support**: Detect document language and prompt AI accordingly
- **RTL Consideration**: Architecture supports RTL languages for future expansion

### Reliability
- **Auto-Save**: Changes saved every 30s with visual confirmation
- **Conflict Resolution**: Clear UI for merge conflicts with side-by-side comparison
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful degradation if AI service unavailable (fall back to manual mode)
- **Data Integrity**: Git-based versioning ensures no data loss

---

## Technical Constraints & Decisions

### Platform Considerations

**Decision Point**: Obsidian Plugin vs Standalone App vs Both?

**Option A: Obsidian Plugin First** (Recommended for MVP)
- **Pros**:
  - Existing user base of knowledge workers
  - Markdown-native environment
  - Leverage Obsidian's sync, mobile, and plugin ecosystem
  - Faster MVP (no need to build full editor)
- **Cons**:
  - Limited to Obsidian users initially
  - Plugin API constraints (but sufficient for our needs)
  - Approval process for community plugins
- **Effort**: Medium (5-8 weeks)

**Option B: Standalone Electron App**
- **Pros**:
  - Full control over UX/UI
  - Reach non-Obsidian users
  - Native OS integrations possible
- **Cons**:
  - Must build full markdown editor (high complexity)
  - Slower MVP (10-16 weeks)
  - Cross-platform testing burden
- **Effort**: Large (12-20 weeks)

**Option C: Web App (React + Monaco/CodeMirror)**
- **Pros**:
  - Accessible via browser (no install)
  - Easiest cross-platform deployment
  - Progressive Web App for mobile
- **Cons**:
  - Less native feel than Obsidian/Electron
  - Sync complexity (need to build or integrate service)
  - API key storage in browser (security trade-offs)
- **Effort**: Medium-Large (8-14 weeks)

**Recommendation**: Start with **Option A (Obsidian Plugin)** for MVP to validate Saligo Writing methodology with real users quickly. Expand to Option C (Web App) post-MVP for broader reach. Option B (Electron) only if strong user demand and resources permit.

### AI Integration Architecture

**Technology Stack**:
- **LLM Orchestration**: LangChain or direct API calls (evaluate based on complexity)
- **Primary AI Provider**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (best for nuanced writing analysis)
- **Secondary**: GPT-4 Turbo (fallback), Gemini Pro (cost-effective alternative)
- **Prompt Management**: Centralized prompt templates with versioning
- **Token Optimization**: Sliding window for large documents (analyze 2000 tokens at a time)

**API Call Flow**:
1. User triggers AI command (e.g., "Find Centers")
2. Client extracts relevant context (current paragraph + surrounding 2 paragraphs)
3. Client constructs prompt with context + system instructions
4. Send to selected AI provider API
5. Parse structured response (JSON mode for Claude/GPT)
6. Render results in UI with accept/dismiss actions

**Cost Estimates** (per user per month, assuming 20 documents):
- Light usage: 50 AI calls x $0.02 avg = $1.00/month
- Heavy usage: 200 AI calls x $0.02 avg = $4.00/month
- User pays own API costs (bring-your-own-key model)

---

### GitHub Integration

**Use Case**: Version control and optional sync
**Implementation**:
- Use GitHub API (Octokit.js) for repo operations
- User provides personal access token (stored encrypted)
- Each document maps to .md file in user's designated repo
- Commits on each snapshot save with message: "Snapshot: [user-provided name]"
- Pull before edit, push after save (simple conflict detection)
- Option for manual vs auto-commit

**Alternative**: Local-first with optional Git sync
- Use isomorphic-git for browser-based Git operations
- No GitHub account required for offline use
- Sync to GitHub only if user configures

**Recommendation**: Local-first approach for MVP simplicity, GitHub sync as P1 feature

---

### Markdown Compatibility

**Requirements**:
- Standard Markdown (CommonMark spec)
- Support for: headings, lists, links, images, code blocks, tables
- WriteAlive metadata stored as YAML frontmatter:
  ```yaml
  ---
  writealive:
    centers:
      - text: "core insight here"
        paragraph: 3
        timestamp: "2025-11-01T10:30:00Z"
    snapshots:
      - name: "Initial draft"

## Open Questions & Decisions Needed

### Product Questions

1. **Freemium vs Paid Model?**
   - Option A: Completely free, users bring own API keys (open source)
   - Option B: Free tier with limited AI calls, paid tier with included credits
   - Option C: One-time purchase (indie app model)
   - **Decision Needed By**: Before public launch
   - **Recommendation**: Option A for MVP (BYOK), evaluate B post-PMF

2. **AI Transparency Level?**
   - Show all prompts and responses to users for learning?
   - Or abstract away AI details for simplicity?
   - **Decision Needed By**: Before AI implementation
   - **Recommendation**: Medium transparency - show prompt outlines, allow "Show Full Prompt" for curious users

3. **Center Notation Standard?**
   - Develop formal syntax for marking centers in markdown?
   - Keep it implicit (AI infers, user confirms)?
   - **Decision Needed By**: Epic 2 implementation
   - **Recommendation**: Implicit with optional explicit syntax for power users

4. **Gamification Elements?**
   - Track writing streaks, center evolution depth, wholeness improvements?
   - Keep purely utility-focused?
   - **Decision Needed By**: Post-MVP
   - **Recommendation**: Subtle progress indicators, no aggressive gamification (aligns with Bill Evans' "enjoy the process" philosophy)

### Technical Questions

5. **Editor Choice for Standalone Version?**
   - CodeMirror 6 (modern, extensible, performance)
   - Monaco (VS Code's editor, feature-rich, heavier)
   - ProseMirror (structured editing, complex)
   - **Decision Needed By**: If/when building standalone
   - **Recommendation**: CodeMirror 6 for balance of performance and features

6. **Mobile Strategy?**
   - Responsive web app adequate?
   - Native iOS/Android apps needed?
   - **Decision Needed By**: Post-MVP after usage analytics
   - **Recommendation**: Start with responsive web/Obsidian mobile, evaluate native post-PMF

7. **Real-time Collaboration Architecture?**
   - Operational Transformation (complex, proven)
   - CRDTs (simpler, eventual consistency)
   - Simple turn-based editing with locking
   - **Decision Needed By**: Epic 7 planning
   - **Recommendation**: Start with turn-based, evaluate CRDTs if demand high

## Risks & Mitigation Strategies

### Risk 1: AI Response Quality Inconsistency
**Severity**: High
**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: Users lose trust if center suggestions are frequently irrelevant

**Mitigation**:
- Extensive prompt engineering with examples from actual Saligo Writing documents
- A/B test prompts with internal users before launch
- Collect user feedback: "Was this suggestion helpful?" with thumbs up/down
- Implement prompt versioning to iterate quickly
- Fallback to simpler heuristics if AI confidence is low
- Clear disclaimer: "AI suggestions are starting points, not prescriptions"

---

### Risk 2: API Cost Overruns for Users
**Severity**: Medium
**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: Users surprised by high API bills, negative reviews

**Mitigation**:
- Prominent cost estimator before each AI call
- Monthly budget settings with warnings at 50%, 80%, 100%
- Client-side rate limiting (max X calls per hour)
- Efficient prompts (minimize tokens without sacrificing quality)
- Cache identical requests for 24 hours
- Provide cost comparison guide: "Center finding typically costs $0.01"

---

### Risk 3: Methodology Learning Curve
**Severity**: High
**Probability**: High
**Impact**: Users don't understand Saligo Writing principles, use tool ineffectively

**Mitigation**:
- Interactive onboarding tutorial: "Write a seed sentence, discover centers, expand"
- In-app contextual help tooltips explaining concepts (Wholeness, Centers, Generative Sequence)
- Example documents with annotations showing Saligo process
- Video tutorials with Kim Changjon or community experts
- "Saligo Score" that teaches principles through feedback
- Community forum for sharing techniques

---

### Risk 4: Obsidian Plugin Approval Delays
**Severity**: Medium
**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: Delayed MVP launch, missed momentum

**Mitigation**:
- Review Obsidian plugin guidelines thoroughly before development
- Submit early draft for community feedback
- Engage with Obsidian developer community during development
- Have web app MVP ready as backup distribution channel
- Offer beta via BRAT (Beta Reviewers Auto-update Tester) while awaiting approval

---

### Risk 5: Over-Reliance on AI (Human Agency Loss)
**Severity**: Medium
**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: Users become passive, let AI write instead of discovering their own voice

**Mitigation**:
- Design philosophy: AI suggests, human decides (never auto-apply)
- Suggestions are starting points, not replacements
- Track "AI acceptance rate" - flag if >80% (user may be over-reliant)
- Periodic prompts: "Take a moment to find centers yourself before asking AI"
- Celebrate user-identified centers prominently
- Bill Evans principle: "Build your own foundation, tools assist"

---

### Risk 6: Data Loss (Sync Conflicts, Corruption)
**Severity**: High
**Probability**: Low
**Impact**: Catastrophic user trust loss if writing is lost

**Mitigation**:
- Git-based versioning (nearly impossible to lose data)
- Automatic local backups every 5 minutes (keep 100 most recent)
- Clear conflict resolution UI (never silent overwrites)
- Export function (download all data as .zip anytime)
- Canary tests: Simulate conflicts in staging environment
- Incident response plan: Priority 0 if data loss reported

---

### Risk 7: Limited AI Context Window for Long Documents
**Severity**: Medium
**Probability**: High
**Impact**: AI suggestions become less relevant in documents >10k words

**Mitigation**:
- Sliding window approach (analyze section + surrounding context)
- Document structure map (AI sees outline + current section content)
- User can explicitly provide context: "Consider this earlier section too"
- Progressive summarization for long docs (extract key centers from each section)
- Set expectations: "Works best on documents under 20k words"
- Future: RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) for full document context

---

## MVP Definition (Must-Ship for Initial Launch)

**Goal**: Validate that Saligo Writing with AI assistance reduces entry friction and increases writing completion rates

**Included Epics**:
- Epic 1: Low-Energy Writing Initiation (US-1.1, US-1.2)
- Epic 2: AI-Assisted Center Discovery (US-2.1, US-2.2, US-2.3)
- Epic 3: Iterative Refinement Tools (US-3.1, US-3.2)
- Epic 4: Academic Writing Structure Support (US-4.1, US-4.2)

**Platform**: Obsidian Plugin (can expand to web app post-MVP)

**MVP Success Criteria**:
1. 50 beta users complete onboarding
2. 30% use tool for 2+ weeks consecutively
3. Average 3+ documents per active user
4. 70% report "writing feels easier" in exit survey
5. 60% of started documents marked complete (vs 20% industry baseline)

**Out of Scope for MVP**:
- Multi-LLM support (Claude only)
- GitHub automatic sync (manual export/import only)
- Collaborative features
- Mobile-specific optimizations
- Advanced analytics/gamification

**Timeline**: 12-16 weeks from kickoff to beta launch

## Design Principles (Transformation-Centered)

### 1. Preserve Structural Life
- Every feature must enhance cohesion, not fragment attention
- Minimize modal dialogs - use inline/sidebar for AI suggestions
- Visual hierarchy: Writing content always primary, tools secondary
- Respect user's flow state - no interrupting notifications

### 2. Generative Sequence Over Iteration
- Frame development as "What's the next small structural improvement?"
- Each Transformation enhances one aspect: center discovery, wholeness analysis, refinement
- No "version 2.0 rewrites" - evolve features incrementally
- Document impact: "This change improved paragraph unity detection by 15%"

### 3. Truth Over Approximation (Bill Evans Principle)
- Better to do one thing perfectly than many things poorly
- MVP focuses on core Saligo loop: seed → centers → expand → refine
- No "good enough" AI prompts - rigorously test with real writing samples
- Measure what matters: completion rate, not feature count

### 4. Co-Design with Users
- Users are collaborators, not customers to satisfy
- Early beta program treats users as co-creators
- Weekly feedback sessions during MVP development
- Transformation decisions explained transparently in changelog
- User scenarios directly become Transformation Intents

### 5. Living Documentation
- This PRD evolves with product - not frozen at kickoff
- Each shipped Transformation updates relevant sections
- Open questions get resolved and documented
- Success metrics reviewed quarterly, adjusted based on learning
