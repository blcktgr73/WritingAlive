# WriteAlive Tutorial: Experience Saligo Writing Hands-On

> This tutorial is a hands-on guide to experiencing **Saligo Writing** using the WriteAlive plugin.
> Like Bill Evans' practice philosophy: **"Don't approximate the whole vaguely. Take a small part and be entirely true, entirely real, entirely accurate about it."**

## 🎯 Tutorial Goals

1. **Start writing with low energy** - Begin without a perfect outline
2. **Experience generative writing** - Watch your writing grow like a tree from a seed
3. **Discover centers** - Find the most alive parts of your writing
4. **Feel wholeness** - Experience how your writing becomes more coherent and stronger

## 📖 Scenario: Writing About "My Practice Method"

### Background Story
You recently watched a video about Bill Evans' practice philosophy:
> "Don't approximate the whole vaguely. Take a small part and be entirely true, entirely real, entirely accurate about it."

You realized this applies to your guitar practice, writing practice, and even programming learning.
You want to write about this insight, but don't know where to start.

**Traditional approach?**
- "Introduction: The Importance of Practice"
- "Body 1: Bill Evans' Philosophy"
- "Body 2: Application to My Experience"
- "Conclusion: Future Commitment"

By the time you finish planning this structure, you're too exhausted to write.

**Saligo Writing approach?**
You just need one seed. You can start right now.

## 🌱 Step 1: Seed Gathering

### 1-1. Collect Ideas Over a Week

WriteAlive gathers thoughts you've already noted.

**Monday - Subway to work (Mobile)**
```markdown
# 2025-11-04-subway-note.md
Watched Bill Evans video.
"Don't approximate the whole vaguely" was shocking.
I've always tried to play entire guitar songs roughly.
#seed #practice
```

**Tuesday - Lunch break (Mobile voice memo)**
```markdown
# 2025-11-05-lunch-idea.md
When I practiced guitar yesterday
I practiced only the first 4 bars perfectly
The rest came easily after
#idea #guitar #💡
```

**Wednesday - Thought during meeting (Desktop)**
```markdown
# 2025-11-06-meeting-thought.md
Realized during code review:
Writing one small function properly
is better than roughing out the whole structure
This is also Bill Evans' approach, right?
#seed #programming
```

**Thursday - Evening walk (Mobile photo + note)**
```markdown
# 2025-11-07-park-walk.md
![[tree-growth.jpg]]
Trees grow from trunk to branches.
Shouldn't writing work the same way?
#seed #nature
```

### 2-4. Write First Paragraph (Low Energy!)

Now that you've found the center, start with **low energy**:

```markdown
# My Practice Method

Bill Evans said: "Don't approximate the whole vaguely.
Take a small part and be entirely true about it."
I heard this and reflected on my guitar practice.
```

**You can stop here!**
With just 3 sentences, you've started writing.
No need for complete structure or outline. Just this part is **true** right now.

## 🌿 Step 3: Generative Expansion

### 3-1. AI Suggests Expansion Directions

After writing your initial draft, ask WriteAlive for next step suggestions:

**Method 1: Ribbon Button**
- Right-click the 🌱 icon in the left sidebar
- Select "Suggest Next Steps"

**Method 2: Command Palette**
- **Cmd/Ctrl + P** → `WriteAlive: Suggest Next Steps`

WriteAlive analyzes your document and suggests 2-4 expansion directions:

```
---

## 🌿 Next Steps for Your Writing

**Current Wholeness**: 6.5/10
**Key Themes**: practice method, perfectionism, learning process

### ⭐⭐⭐ Deepen - Add Concrete Experience
**Direction**: What happened when you practiced the first 4 bars perfectly?

**Why this matters**: Your writing has a strong concept but needs lived experience to ground it. Readers connect through sensory details and specific moments.

**Content hints**:
- Describe the physical sensation when your fingers "knew" the pattern
- What changed in your body between attempt 1 and attempt 20?
- Include a specific mistake you made and how you caught it

**Estimated length**: 2-3 paragraphs

---

### ⭐⭐ Connect - Link to Other Domains
**Direction**: You mentioned discovering the same principle in programming. Develop this connection.

**Why this matters**: Cross-domain connections reveal deeper patterns and make your insight more universal.

**Content hints**:
- Which programming practice mirrors "small part, entirely true"?
- Was there a specific bug or refactoring moment?
- How did both experiences teach you the same lesson?

**Estimated length**: 2-3 paragraphs

---

### ⭐ Question - Explore Tension
**Direction**: What happens when you can't find "the small part" to focus on?

**Why this matters**: Addressing limitations and challenges adds depth and honesty to your writing.

**Content hints**:
- When does the "perfect 4 bars" method fail?
- Are there times when you need to see the whole first?
- How do you know when to zoom in vs. zoom out?

**Estimated length**: 1-2 paragraphs

---

**Cost**: $0.02 (3,247 tokens) • **Provider**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet
```

You choose the **"Deepen"** suggestion (feels most alive).

### 3-2. Add Concrete Experience

```markdown
# My Practice Method

Bill Evans said: "Don't approximate the whole vaguely.
Take a small part and be entirely true about it."
I heard this and reflected on my guitar practice.

Yesterday, I got frustrated trying to learn a new song.
I tried to play the whole 3-minute song at once,
and after an hour, it was still awkward and stumbling.

But I remembered Bill Evans' words and changed my approach.
I practiced just the first 4 bars.
I repeated the same 4 bars 20 times.

Something amazing happened.
By the 20th time, my fingers moved on their own.
Accurate notes came out without thinking.
That's when I understood physically what
"being entirely true" in practice means.
```

**Wholeness Score: 7.2/10** (WriteAlive automatic analysis)

---

## 📊 Step 4: Wholeness Analysis

### 4-1. AI Structural Analysis

**Cmd/Ctrl + P** → `WriteAlive: Analyze Wholeness`

```
📊 Wholeness Analysis Result

Overall Score: 7.2/10 (Good)

✅ Strengths:
  • Explains abstract concept with concrete experience (strong center)
  • Natural flow: "hear → reflect → apply → understand"
  • "understood physically" - powerful ending

⚠️ Room for Improvement:
  • Programming example not yet connected (seed remains)
  • Tree metaphor unused (another seed)
  • Needs bigger context for "why this matters"

💡 Next iteration:
  Adding Option B (tree metaphor) could raise wholeness to 8.5
```

### 4-2. Save Snapshot

**Cmd/Ctrl + P** → `WriteAlive: Save Snapshot`

```
✅ Snapshot saved: "My Practice Method v1 (Wholeness 7.2)"

You can return to this version anytime.
Experiment safely!
```

---

## 🔄 Step 5: Iterative Refinement

### 5-1. Add Tree Metaphor (2nd Expansion)

Following AI suggestion, select Option B:

```markdown
# My Practice Method

[...keep previous part...]

Something amazing happened.
By the 20th time, my fingers moved on their own.
Accurate notes came out without thinking.

I remembered the tree I saw on my walk.
Trees grow from trunk to branches.
They don't spread all branches at once from the start.
When the trunk is strong, branches come naturally.
When each branch grows properly, leaves flourish.

I realized my practice should be the same.
When the first 4 bars - my 'trunk' - became strong,
the next 4 bars - my 'branches' - followed naturally.
```

**Wholeness Score: 8.3/10** ⬆️ (+1.1)

### 5-2. Read Aloud

WriteAlive also supports traditional writing methods:

**Cmd/Ctrl + P** → `WriteAlive: Read Aloud Feedback`

```
🔊 Read Aloud Analysis

✅ Reads Well:
  • "Something amazing happened" - good rhythm
  • "trunk → branches → leaves" - clear repetition

⚠️ Awkward Parts:
  • "That's when I understood physically" - slightly awkward
  → Suggestion: "That's when I physically grasped"

  • "Accurate notes came out without thinking" - too long
  → Suggestion: "Notes came out effortlessly" or split into two sentences
```

### 5-3. Final Polish

```markdown
# Reaching Completeness in Practice: What I Learned from Bill Evans

Bill Evans said: "Don't approximate the whole vaguely.
Take a small part and be entirely true about it."
I heard this and reflected on my guitar practice.

Yesterday, I got frustrated trying to learn a new song.
I tried to play the whole 3-minute song at once,
and after an hour, it was still awkward and stumbling.

But I remembered Bill Evans' words and changed my approach.
I practiced just the first 4 bars.
I repeated the same 4 bars 20 times.

Something amazing happened.
By the 20th time, my fingers moved on their own.
Notes came out effortlessly.

I remembered the tree I saw on my walk.
Trees grow from trunk to branches.
They don't spread all branches at once from the start.
When the trunk is strong, branches come naturally.
When each branch grows properly, leaves flourish.

I realized my practice should be the same.
When the first 4 bars - my 'trunk' - became strong,
the next 4 bars - my 'branches' - followed naturally.

Now when I encounter a new song, I ask:
"What part will I practice entirely true today?"
I learned that fully embodying a small part
is ultimately faster and deeper
than roughly knowing the whole.
```

**Final Wholeness Score: 9.1/10** ⬆️⬆️
