# WriteAlive Tutorial: Experience Saligo Writing Hands-On

> This tutorial is a hands-on guide to experiencing **Saligo Writing** using the WriteAlive plugin.
> Like Bill Evans' practice philosophy: **"Don't approximate the whole vaguely. Take a small part and be entirely true, entirely real, entirely accurate about it."**

## 🎯 Tutorial Goals

1. **Start writing with low energy** - Begin without a perfect outline
2. **Experience generative writing** - Watch your writing grow like a tree from a seed
3. **Discover centers** - Find the most alive parts of your writing
4. **Feel wholeness** - Experience how your writing becomes more coherent and stronger

## 📖 Scenario: Writing About "My Practice Method"

### Background Story
You recently watched a video about Bill Evans' practice philosophy:
> "Don't approximate the whole vaguely. Take a small part and be entirely true, entirely real, entirely accurate about it."

You realized this applies to your guitar practice, writing practice, and even programming learning.
You want to write about this insight, but don't know where to start.

**Traditional approach?**
- "Introduction: The Importance of Practice"
- "Body 1: Bill Evans' Philosophy"
- "Body 2: Application to My Experience"
- "Conclusion: Future Commitment"

By the time you finish planning this structure, you're too exhausted to write.

**Saligo Writing approach?**
You just need one seed. You can start right now.

## 🌱 Step 1: Seed Gathering

### 1-1. Collect Ideas Over a Week

WriteAlive gathers thoughts you've already noted.

**Monday - Subway to work (Mobile)**
```markdown
# 2025-11-04-subway-note.md
Watched Bill Evans video.
"Don't approximate the whole vaguely" was shocking.
I've always tried to play entire guitar songs roughly.
#seed #practice
```

**Tuesday - Lunch break (Mobile voice memo)**
```markdown
# 2025-11-05-lunch-idea.md
When I practiced guitar yesterday
I practiced only the first 4 bars perfectly
The rest came easily after
#idea #guitar #💡
```

**Wednesday - Thought during meeting (Desktop)**
```markdown
# 2025-11-06-meeting-thought.md
Realized during code review:
Writing one small function properly
is better than roughing out the whole structure
This is also Bill Evans' approach, right?
#seed #programming
```

**Thursday - Evening walk (Mobile photo + note)**
```markdown
# 2025-11-07-park-walk.md
![[tree-growth.jpg]]
Trees grow from trunk to branches.
Shouldn't writing work the same way?
#seed #nature
```

### 1-2. Gather Seeds with WriteAlive

**Friday evening - Finally time to write!**

1. **Open Obsidian**
2. **Ctrl/Cmd + P** → Run `WriteAlive: Gather Seeds` command
3. **Amazing result:**

```markdown
🌱 Seeds Found (4)

✅ 2025-11-04 - "Don't approximate the whole vaguely" #seed #practice
✅ 2025-11-05 - "First 4 bars perfectly" #idea #guitar
✅ 2025-11-06 - "One small function properly" #seed #programming
✅ 2025-11-07 - "Trees grow from trunk to branches" #seed #nature

Select all? [All] [Custom]
```

**Why is this amazing?**
- **Recognizes emoji tags** (`#💡`)
- **Auto-syncs mobile notes**
- **Includes photos**
- **Bilingual support** (works with any language)

You select "All". New note `My Practice Method.md` created.

---

## 🎯 Step 2: Center Finding

### 2-1. AI Finds Centers for You

WriteAlive analyzes your 4 seeds:

```markdown
# My Practice Method (Draft)

2025-11-04 - "Don't approximate the whole vaguely" #seed #practice
2025-11-05 - "First 4 bars perfectly" #idea #guitar
2025-11-06 - "One small function properly" #seed #programming
2025-11-07 - "Trees grow from trunk to branches" #seed #nature
```

**AI Analysis Result:**

```
🎯 Centers Discovered:

1. [Strong Center ⭐⭐⭐] "Completeness vs Approximation"
   - Core of Bill Evans' philosophy
   - Principle that runs through guitar and programming

2. [Medium Center ⭐⭐] "Part to Whole"
   - Tree growth metaphor
   - Natural expansion

3. [Weak Center ⭐] "Cross-domain Application"
   - Connecting music, coding, writing

💡 Recommendation: Start with "Completeness vs Approximation"
This is the most alive part.
```

### 2-2. Write First Paragraph

Now that you've found the center, start with **low energy**:

```markdown
# My Practice Method

Bill Evans said: "Don't approximate the whole vaguely.
Take a small part and be entirely true about it."
I heard this and reflected on my guitar practice.
```

**You can stop here!**
With just 3 sentences, you've started writing.
No need for complete structure or outline. Just this part is **true** right now.

---

## 🌿 Step 3: Generative Expansion

### 3-1. AI Suggests Expansion Directions

**Cmd/Ctrl + P** → `WriteAlive: Suggest Expansions`

```
🌿 Directions your writing wants to grow:

Option A: Add Concrete Experience (⭐⭐⭐ Recommended)
  "What happened when you practiced the first 4 bars perfectly?
   Write so readers can feel that experience."

Option B: Use Nature Metaphor (⭐⭐)
  "How does tree growth resemble your practice?
   Develop thoughts while looking at the photo."

Option C: Connect to Other Domains (⭐)
  "You discovered the same principle in programming?
   What was that moment?"
```

You choose **Option A** (feels most alive).

### 3-2. Add Concrete Experience

```markdown
# My Practice Method

Bill Evans said: "Don't approximate the whole vaguely.
Take a small part and be entirely true about it."
I heard this and reflected on my guitar practice.

Yesterday, I got frustrated trying to learn a new song.
I tried to play the whole 3-minute song at once,
and after an hour, it was still awkward and stumbling.

But I remembered Bill Evans' words and changed my approach.
I practiced just the first 4 bars.
I repeated the same 4 bars 20 times.

Something amazing happened.
By the 20th time, my fingers moved on their own.
Accurate notes came out without thinking.
That's when I understood physically what
"being entirely true" in practice means.
```

**Wholeness Score: 7.2/10** (WriteAlive automatic analysis)

---

## 📊 Step 4: Wholeness Analysis

### 4-1. AI Structural Analysis

**Cmd/Ctrl + P** → `WriteAlive: Analyze Wholeness`

```
📊 Wholeness Analysis Result

Overall Score: 7.2/10 (Good)

✅ Strengths:
  • Explains abstract concept with concrete experience (strong center)
  • Natural flow: "hear → reflect → apply → understand"
  • "understood physically" - powerful ending

⚠️ Room for Improvement:
  • Programming example not yet connected (seed remains)
  • Tree metaphor unused (another seed)
  • Needs bigger context for "why this matters"

💡 Next iteration:
  Adding Option B (tree metaphor) could raise wholeness to 8.5
```

### 4-2. Save Snapshot

**Cmd/Ctrl + P** → `WriteAlive: Save Snapshot`

```
✅ Snapshot saved: "My Practice Method v1 (Wholeness 7.2)"

You can return to this version anytime.
Experiment safely!
```

---

## 🔄 Step 5: Iterative Refinement

### 5-1. Add Tree Metaphor (2nd Expansion)

Following AI suggestion, select Option B:

```markdown
# My Practice Method

[...keep previous part...]

Something amazing happened.
By the 20th time, my fingers moved on their own.
Accurate notes came out without thinking.

I remembered the tree I saw on my walk.
Trees grow from trunk to branches.
They don't spread all branches at once from the start.
When the trunk is strong, branches come naturally.
When each branch grows properly, leaves flourish.

I realized my practice should be the same.
When the first 4 bars - my 'trunk' - became strong,
the next 4 bars - my 'branches' - followed naturally.
```

**Wholeness Score: 8.3/10** ⬆️ (+1.1)

### 5-2. Read Aloud

WriteAlive also supports traditional writing methods:

**Cmd/Ctrl + P** → `WriteAlive: Read Aloud Feedback`

```
🔊 Read Aloud Analysis

✅ Reads Well:
  • "Something amazing happened" - good rhythm
  • "trunk → branches → leaves" - clear repetition

⚠️ Awkward Parts:
  • "That's when I understood physically" - slightly awkward
  → Suggestion: "That's when I physically grasped"

  • "Accurate notes came out without thinking" - too long
  → Suggestion: "Notes came out effortlessly" or split into two sentences
```

### 5-3. Final Polish

```markdown
# Reaching Completeness in Practice: What I Learned from Bill Evans

Bill Evans said: "Don't approximate the whole vaguely.
Take a small part and be entirely true about it."
I heard this and reflected on my guitar practice.

Yesterday, I got frustrated trying to learn a new song.
I tried to play the whole 3-minute song at once,
and after an hour, it was still awkward and stumbling.

But I remembered Bill Evans' words and changed my approach.
I practiced just the first 4 bars.
I repeated the same 4 bars 20 times.

Something amazing happened.
By the 20th time, my fingers moved on their own.
Notes came out effortlessly.

I remembered the tree I saw on my walk.
Trees grow from trunk to branches.
They don't spread all branches at once from the start.
When the trunk is strong, branches come naturally.
When each branch grows properly, leaves flourish.

I realized my practice should be the same.
When the first 4 bars - my 'trunk' - became strong,
the next 4 bars - my 'branches' - followed naturally.

Now when I encounter a new song, I ask:
"What part will I practice entirely true today?"
I learned that fully embodying a small part
is ultimately faster and deeper
than roughly knowing the whole.
```

**Final Wholeness Score: 9.1/10** ⬆️⬆️

**Q: I can't find centers.**
A: AI helps. If still unsure, just start with one seed that "feels right".

**Q: My wholeness score is low.**
A: That's okay! 7.0+ is good writing. 9.0+ is excellent writing.

**Q: Doesn't this conflict with traditional structure (intro-body-conclusion)?**
A: No! Use Saligo Writing to grow content, then polish with Academic Writing techniques later.

**Q: Does it work in other languages?**
A: Yes! English, Korean, mixed - all supported.
